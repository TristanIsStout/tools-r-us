# Tools-R-Us
Application to rent tools

## Dependencies
This app requires a 1.8+ Java SDK, and junit 4 to be in the classpath. For help putting junit in the classpath, refer to this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21369953/need-help-installing-junit-on-mac-how-to-add-junit-to-path-environmental-variabl?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa). 

## Running
Running `./test.sh` will run the tests. The shell script needs execution privilege, which can be accomplished by running `chmod u+x test.sh`.
